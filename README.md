# Coders in Hoods JS Project

You've learned the foundations of Javascript, now it's time to build a project.

We've provided you with an example project, you can follow this or do your own thing. This is just a _suggestion_ and a starting point, you can build much more exciting projects!

## API

We're using `json-server` for a quick RESTful API, perfect to prototyping. Read the [documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to explore all the features.

Currently, our API only serving some `tweets`. Change the contents of `db.json` to serve some different data.

You'll need to install `json-server` by running `npm install -g json-server` in your terminal (you'll need `node` and `npm` installed to run this).

Then run `json-server db.json` and you'll have an API!

## Client

There's an HTML page, a JS file and some CSS. The `scripts` directory should be where you write all your JS code. We've kept everything in `index.js`, but when you're project grows you should split it up into separate files.

## Suggestions

We've made a simple Twitter-style app. Some ideas for your project are:

- Movies! `/films`, `/actors`, `/reviews`
- Food! `/recipes`, `/ingredients`, `/occasions`
- Photos! Use the Unsplash API to make photo boards (Pinterest-style)
- E-commerce! Show a page of `/products`, select a product to add it to your basket
- Don't feel limited to these suggestions, have some fun!
